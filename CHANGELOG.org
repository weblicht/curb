* 1.x

** 1.5

This is actually the first release of this library. The library
contains code split out from germanet-common 1.4.6; hence the version
number. The generic, lower-level components have been moved out of
germanet-common to enable them to be reused in projects that have
nothing to do with GermaNet.

There have been a few small changes as a result of the split:

- The props interface to the =ManagedForm= component is now slightly
  different: the =submitTo= and =onSuccess= callbacks should no longer
  return thunks to be dispatched by redux-thunk. Instead, the
  callbacks are simply called directly inside =ManagedForm=. This
  keeps the library free of dependencies on Redux, redux-thunk, and
  react-redux.
